    <h1>Where is Mexico?</h1>
    <p>
        Southern North America is home to Mexico, also known as the United Mexican States.
        Belize and Guatemala both border Mexico to the south, and the United States neighbours it to the north.
        Mexico’s eastern coastlines are defined by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, while its western sides stretch along the Pacific Ocean.
        Due to Mexico’s advantageous location between North and Central America, it is an important player in regional economic and cultural interactions.

        <h2>Geography of Mexico</h2>
        <p>
            There are various separate regions within Mexico's tremendously diversified terrain, each providing visitors with a unique experience. 
            The stunning Sierra Madre mountain ranges surround the vast Mexican Plateau, and it is here that towns like Mexico City thrive due to the area's moderate, temperate environment. 
            Hikers who desire adventure can take on the challenge of climbing large peaks, and culture-seekers may find hidden historical treasures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Travellers are welcome to discover the tropical jungles, historical Mayan ruins, and fascinating cenotes—natural sinkholes ideal for a cool swim—of the Yucatán Peninsula, which is located to the south. 
            The nation's beaches are similarly breathtaking: the Pacific Ocean in the west offers breathtaking sunsets and world-class surfing, while the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea in the east provide great swimming conditions ideal for snorkelling and diving. With everything from deserts to rainforests and mountains to serene beaches, Mexico’s varied regions provide a wealth of adventures for every type of traveller.
